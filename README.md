# What is an SSH key and how to create one?
An SSH key is a keypair that allows you to log into an SSH server with your own customized password. You enter a generated public key into the server and once your client is set up, it helps identify the public key with the generated private key.

1. Install Puttygen via https://www.puttygen.com/.
2. Open the application named Puttygen.
3. Make sure RSA is selected.
4. Press the Generate button next to the text "Generate a public/private key pair".
5. Move your mouse over the white area as it requests.
6. You should now see something like this: https://gyazo.com/7882a59d38061601b458c98e7ec28769
7. Copy the **full** Public Key and copy it into the authorized_keys file.
8. Commit & Push it.
9. Enter a password into the field "Key passphrase" and copy this to "Confirm passphrase".
10. Save this file to a place where you won't lose it.
11. You can now import the private key into your preferred SSH client, like Putty or Terminus.
